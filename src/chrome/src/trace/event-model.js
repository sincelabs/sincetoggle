/**
 * Trace event model — the shared vocabulary and envelope for the per-run event
 * log written by trace/recorder.js.
 *
 * Pure and browser-neutral so it can be unit-tested in test/run.js without a
 * DOM or IndexedDB.
 *
 * The recorder stores events as {runId, seq, ts, kind, data}. This module owns:
 *   - the authoritative list of known event kinds. The recorder, Traces UI,
 *     and exporters consult it instead of maintaining their own lists, so a
 *     new event type has one place to be declared;
 *   - the run-level trace format version stamped on every new run record, so
 *     a future schema change can detect old traces instead of misreading them;
 *   - envelope construction with write-side validation: unknown kinds and
 *     data that cannot survive a JSON round-trip are rejected here, so a
 *     recording bug surfaces at write time rather than as a ghost event.
 *
 * Events are privacy-filtered at their recording call sites (see
 * prompt-provenance.js); nothing in this module adds or requires content.
