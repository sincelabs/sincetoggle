# DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision (NVFP4)

![deepseek-v4-vision](deepseek-vision-improved.gif)

**DeepSeek V4 Flash with sight.** A vision-language development
checkpoint that connects DeepSeek's reasoning and agentic model to the MoonViT
vision encoder from
[Kimi-K2.6](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6) through a trained,
routing-aware PatchMerger projector.

The text backbone and vision tower remain frozen. The only newly trained
parameters are the **40,119,040-parameter projector** that merges each 2x2 group
of MoonViT patches and maps the resulting 4608-dimensional representation into
DeepSeek's 4096-dimensional token space. Original text routing IDs are preserved;
image positions receive deterministic routing IDs from a fixed 64-ID palette.

## Why vision at WebBrain

At [WebBrain](https://www.webbrain.one), we build browser agents that need to
understand the visual state of the web—not just extracted text. Screenshots,
charts, dashboards, rich editors, and the location and appearance of controls
are part of real browser work, so vision is a practical product requirement.

In our
[American–Chinese open-model frontier benchmark](https://www.webbrain.one/blog/american-chinese-open-model-frontier-gap-benchmark),
DeepSeek V4 Flash stood out as a very strong model and the cheapest to run in its class, but the upstream
checkpoint is text-only. This project adds a basic MoonViT vision bridge while
keeping both the language backbone and vision tower frozen.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pinned NVFP4 text backbone, frozen MoonViT tower, and trained
> 100K-example projector are complete and verified. Reference BF16 multimodal
> inference has passed end-to-end and KV-cache parity checks. The repository now
> includes a custom, commit-pinned SGLang processor, routing bridge, source patch,
> and B200 launch recipe. The pinned B200 runtime has passed full NVFP4 loading
> and server startup plus two live image-generation smoke tests. Broader text-only
> parity and production validation are still required.
> This is not a drop-in checkpoint for a stock text-only server.

## Provenance

The packaged text backbone is copied from
[nvidia/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-NVFP4)
at immutable revision
[e3cd60e7de98e9867116860d522499a728de1cf9](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-NVFP4/commit/e3cd60e7de98e9867116860d522499a728de1cf9).
All 54 copied files were checked against their upstream Git blob or LFS SHA-256
fingerprints after upload.

Projector training uses a frozen BF16 reconstruction of DeepSeek V4 Flash because
the released inference quantization kernels do not provide the input-gradient
path needed to train through a frozen language model. MoonViT is pinned to
Kimi-K2.6 revision
[7eb5002f6aadc958aed6a9177b7ed26bb94011bb](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6/commit/7eb5002f6aadc958aed6a9177b7ed26bb94011bb).
This package pairs the trained projector with the verified NVIDIA NVFP4
backbone above. Reference BF16 parity and live B200 image generation have been
validated; broader text-only parity and production behavior are not claimed.

## Usage

Stock text-only engines do not know how to combine these artifacts. Use the
custom, version-pinned SGLang package and wrapper in
[`docs/SGLANG_DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/SGLANG_DEPLOYMENT.md). The B200 startup
profile is selected explicitly and keeps the first correctness run conservative:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_MODEL_PATH=/models/deepseek-v4-flash-vision
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_PYTHONPATH="$DEEPSEEK_VISION_MODEL_PATH/sglang_ext"
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_KERNEL_PROFILE=blackwell-native
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_TP=4
scripts/launch_sglang_moonvit.sh
```

The wrapper uses the native `flashinfer_trtllm` dense backend and
`flashinfer_trtllm_routed` MoE backend on the documented B200 image. Two live
image-response smoke tests passed on this profile; do not treat that bounded
smoke result as production validation.

## Method credit

The overall construction and model-card approach was inspired by
[Baseten's GLM-5.2-Vision-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/baseten/GLM-5.2-Vision-NVFP4):
keep the text backbone and MoonViT tower frozen, train a compact PatchMerger
projector between them, and publish provenance and hardware constraints
explicitly. Credit to the Baseten team for demonstrating this practical recipe.

This project adds a DeepSeek-specific routing bridge so mixed text/image
embeddings preserve hash-routed text behavior. It does not reuse Baseten model
weights, benchmark results, or deployment artifacts.

later will remain subject to the Kimi-K2.6 Modified MIT terms. Newly trained
projector artifacts will be documented with their applicable terms when

## Want this model on your inference provider?

Ask your inference provider—such as OpenRouter or another OpenAI-compatible
managed service—to deploy this exact repository with its multimodal processor
and serving plugin. Deploying only the upstream text backbone will not enable
image input.
