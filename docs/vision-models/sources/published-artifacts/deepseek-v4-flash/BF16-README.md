# DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision (BF16 source overlay)

![deepseek-v4-vision](deepseek-vision-improved.gif)

**DeepSeek V4 Flash with sight.** This source overlay connects DeepSeek's
reasoning and agentic model to the MoonViT vision encoder from
[Kimi-K2.6](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6) through WebBrain's
trained, routing-aware PatchMerger projector.

The text backbone and vision tower remain frozen. The only newly trained
parameters are the **40,119,040-parameter projector** that merges each 2x2 group
of MoonViT patches and maps the resulting 4608-dimensional representation into
DeepSeek's 4096-dimensional token space. Original text routing IDs are
preserved; image positions receive deterministic routing IDs from a fixed
64-ID palette.

## Why vision at WebBrain

At [WebBrain](https://www.webbrain.one), we build browser agents that need to
understand the visual state of the web—not just extracted text. Screenshots,
charts, dashboards, rich editors, and the location and appearance of controls
are part of real browser work, so vision is a practical product requirement.

In our
[American–Chinese open-model frontier benchmark](https://www.webbrain.one/blog/american-chinese-open-model-frontier-gap-benchmark),
DeepSeek V4 Flash stood out as a very strong and cost-efficient model, but the
upstream checkpoint is text-only. This project adds a MoonViT vision bridge
while keeping both the language backbone and vision tower frozen.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is a BF16 vision source overlay, not a complete 291B BF16
> checkpoint. It contains the genuine BF16 MoonViT tower, trained BF16
> projector, processor, routing bridge, and SGLang integration source. It does
> not contain or claim a full-BF16 conversion of the DeepSeek text backbone.
> When paired with NVIDIA's NVFP4 text backbone, the documented pinned B200
> runtime has passed full shard loading, server startup, and two live image-response
> smoke tests. Other text checkpoints and production use remain unvalidated.

## Provenance

- Vision source: [`moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6)
  at revision
  [`7eb5002f6aadc958aed6a9177b7ed26bb94011bb`](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6/commit/7eb5002f6aadc958aed6a9177b7ed26bb94011bb),
  extracted from the frozen `vision_tower.` namespace without changing tensor
  dtype.
- Projector: the final WebBrain MoonViT projector trained in BF16 on the frozen
  tower and a frozen BF16 reconstruction used for gradient-compatible reference
  training.
- Packaging source: verified vision artifacts and serving glue from
  [`webbrain-one/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/webbrain-one/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-NVFP4).
  No NVFP4 text shard is included here.

## Usage

The repository includes a staging script rather than pretending to be a
standalone Transformers checkpoint:

```bash
# MODEL_DIR must already contain a compatible DeepSeek V4 text checkpoint,
# including config.json and model.safetensors.index.json.
cp vision_tower.safetensors mm_projector.safetensors "$MODEL_DIR/"
python scripts/prepare_sglang_model_repo.py "$MODEL_DIR" --source-root "$PWD"
```

Then use the custom SGLang launch wrapper documented in
[`docs/SGLANG_DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/SGLANG_DEPLOYMENT.md). Stock SGLang does not
know how to inject MoonViT embeddings into DeepSeek V4 routing. The integration
requires the checked-in external model/processor package and a narrow,
version-pinned SGLang source patch.

For the documented NVFP4-on-B200 startup profile:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_MODEL_PATH="$MODEL_DIR"
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_PYTHONPATH="$MODEL_DIR/sglang_ext"
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_KERNEL_PROFILE=blackwell-native
export DEEPSEEK_VISION_TP=4
scripts/launch_sglang_moonvit.sh
```

That profile selects the native `flashinfer_trtllm` dense backend and
`flashinfer_trtllm_routed` MoE backend. The BF16 overlay does not select a
quantized kernel profile by default because it does not include a text
checkpoint.

The first supported correctness endpoint is native `/generate` with one literal
`<image>` marker. OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` image parts are not yet supported
by this source package.

## Status and limitations

- The two published component files are genuine BF16 tensors and have been
  hash-checked.
- Reference BF16 multimodal inference and KV-cache/full-prefix parity passed
  during the original training run.
- The complete DeepSeek text backbone is not included and is not represented as
  BF16.
- The custom SGLang package is a deployment integration, not upstream stock
  support.
- The pinned NVFP4-on-B200 combination has passed full loader/startup gates and
  two consecutive live image-response smoke tests.
- Every other text-checkpoint, hardware, or SGLang combination still requires a
  fresh full-model loader and smoke test.

## Method credit

The overall construction and model-card approach was inspired by
[Baseten's GLM-5.2-Vision-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/baseten/GLM-5.2-Vision-NVFP4):
keep the text backbone and MoonViT tower frozen, train a compact PatchMerger
projector between them, and publish provenance and hardware constraints
explicitly. Credit to the Baseten team for demonstrating this practical recipe.

This project adds a DeepSeek-specific routing bridge so mixed text/image
embeddings preserve hash-routed text behavior. It does not reuse Baseten model
weights, benchmark results, or deployment artifacts.

## Licenses

The DeepSeek text reference is covered by
[`LICENSE_DEEPSEEK_V4_FLASH`](LICENSE_DEEPSEEK_V4_FLASH). The extracted MoonViT
tower is covered by [`LICENSE_KIMI_K2.6`](LICENSE_KIMI_K2.6). The newly trained
projector and integration source are provided under [`LICENSE`](LICENSE);
downstream users remain responsible for complying with both upstream licenses.

## Want this model on your inference provider?

Ask your inference provider—such as OpenRouter or another managed inference
service—to deploy this overlay together with a compatible DeepSeek V4 Flash
text checkpoint and the included multimodal serving plugin. Deploying only the
upstream text model will not enable image input.
