# Laguna XS 2.1 Vision (NVFP4)

![Laguna Vision](laguna-vision.gif)

**Laguna XS 2.1 with sight.** A vision-language development checkpoint
that connects Poolside's agentic coding model to the MoonViT vision encoder from
[Kimi-K2.6](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6) through a trained
PatchMerger projector.

The text backbone and vision tower remain frozen. The only newly trained
parameters are the **30,679,808-parameter projector** that merges each 2x2 group
of MoonViT patches and maps the resulting 4608-dimensional representation into
Laguna's 2048-dimensional token space.


## Why vision at WebBrain

At [WebBrain](https://www.webbrain.one), we build browser agents that need to
understand the visual state of the web—not just extracted text. Screenshots,
charts, dashboards, rich editors, and the location and appearance of controls
are part of real browser work, so vision is a practical product requirement.

In our
[American–Chinese open-model frontier benchmark](https://www.webbrain.one/blog/american-chinese-open-model-frontier-gap-benchmark),
Laguna XS 2.1 stood out as a strong model in its size class, but the upstream
checkpoint is text-only. This project adds a basic MoonViT vision bridge while
keeping both the language backbone and vision tower frozen.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is still being assembled. The pinned NVFP4 text backbone is
> complete and verified, and the frozen MoonViT tower plus final 100K-example
> projector are packaged and fingerprint-verified. Multimodal model code,
> processor/serving integration, NVFP4 equivalence, and final image-inference
> validation are still pending, so this is not yet a stock ready-to-serve
> checkpoint.

| File | Contents | Size | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `vision_tower.safetensors` | Frozen MoonViT-3d tower, 329 tensors, all BF16 | 833,765,768 bytes | `befe801bd7dfe8bf5630fef56a7f53c2235065599ca9eea4d995040e2e6fd183` |

Machine-readable provenance is in
[`VISION_ADAPTER_MANIFEST.json`](VISION_ADAPTER_MANIFEST.json).

## Provenance

The packaged text backbone is copied from
[`poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-NVFP4) at immutable revision
[`d32afde8b09af1539b49ff96ff5551c674485f8e`](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-NVFP4/commit/d32afde8b09af1539b49ff96ff5551c674485f8e).
Every copied file was checked against its upstream Git blob or LFS SHA-256
fingerprint, then independently rechecked after upload.

Projector training used the frozen BF16 Laguna XS 2.1 backbone and frozen
MoonViT-3d features. This repository now pairs the final trained projector and
frozen tower with the verified NVFP4 backbone above. NVFP4 equivalence and
end-to-end behavior will be validated after the remaining multimodal
integration is assembled.

## Usage

A serving command is intentionally not published yet. The current repository
contains the complete text backbone, frozen vision tower, and final projector,
but not the multimodal processor and serving assembly that connects them. A
tested quickstart will be added after integration passes the final gates.

## Method credit

The overall construction and model-card approach was inspired by
[Baseten's GLM-5.2-Vision-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/baseten/GLM-5.2-Vision-NVFP4):
keep the text backbone and MoonViT tower frozen, train a compact PatchMerger
projector between them, and publish the provenance and hardware constraints
explicitly. Credit to the Baseten team for demonstrating this practical recipe.
This repository does not reuse Baseten model weights, benchmark results, or
deployment artifacts.

## License

The redistributed Laguna XS 2.1 NVFP4 backbone remains subject to the included
[OpenMDW-1.1 license](./LICENSE.md) and Poolside's source notices. The included
MoonViT tower remains subject to the included
[Kimi-K2.6 Modified MIT terms](./LICENSE_KIMI_K2.6). The newly trained projector
is documented in the manifest above. Downstream users remain responsible for
complying with both upstream licenses.

## Want this model on your inference provider?

Ask your inference provider—such as OpenRouter or another OpenAI-compatible
managed service—to deploy this exact repository with its multimodal processor
and serving plugin. Deploying only the upstream text backbone will not enable
image input.

## Experimental status, roadmap, and get involved

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental vision package.** The MoonViT adapter and its serving package
> are experimental. Live end-to-end validation of the **NVFP4** package on an
> RTX 5090 is still provisioning: the pinned SGLang container image is being
> fetched, so neither the text nor image smoke test has passed yet. Fine-grained
> OCR, small-object and control identification, GUI grounding, and hallucination
> calibration remain limited. The roadmap is to expand and diversify the
> training data, add more high-resolution OCR and UI examples, and pursue
> broader parameter-efficient tuning if community interest warrants the
> investment. To contribute evaluation or training data, sponsor compute,
> or explore a design partnership, use the [community interest
