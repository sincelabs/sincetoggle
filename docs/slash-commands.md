# Slash Commands

WebBrain accepts slash commands as the first thing on a line in the input box.
Type `/help` in the panel to see complete usage signatures and flag
descriptions. Typing a canonical command followed by a space opens autocomplete
for its available flags.

## `/watch`

`/watch` performs its first check immediately and then polls every 60 seconds by
default. `--secs` accepts 30–120 seconds.

Relative conditions such as "when a new commit appears" establish a baseline on
the first check; absolute conditions such as "when CI is green" can match
immediately.

A trailing `/beep` enables the watch-only alert tool; `--short` and `--long`
select its tone. Alerts play only after a verified successful action, and
`--keep` suppresses repeated alerts for the same stable event key. If a model
verifies the action but omits the optional alert tool, the watch records the
warning and completes or continues without sound.

Polls run in dedicated inactive tabs, so leaving the initiating page does not
navigate it back to the watched URL, and the helper tab is closed when the watch
ends. Transient poll failures are tolerated; three consecutive failures stop the
watch.

## `/foreground`

Regular local runs stay pinned to their original tab and operate without
activating that tab or focusing its window. Chrome captures through CDP with
focus emulation scoped to the run; Firefox captures the target tab directly
with `tabs.captureTab`. If Chrome repeatedly returns a blank background frame,
WebBrain discards it and continues from DOM and accessibility data.

Use `/foreground <prompt>` as a one-run compatibility escape hatch for a site
whose visual state does not render correctly in the background. It restores tab
activation and window focus for that run. The setting is not persistent, and
managed cloud runs retain their existing foreground behavior because their
browser is dedicated to the task.

## `/allow-api`

`/allow-api` lifts the UI-first restriction for the current conversation so the
agent may use POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE via `fetch_url` or `research_url` when the UI
is failing. A badge appears while it is active, and it clears on `/reset`.

To keep the same policy active across conversations and browser restarts, turn
on **Always allow API mutations** under **Settings → General → Advanced**. The
setting is off by default and remains active until you turn it off. `/reset`
still clears the conversation-only `/allow-api` override, but does not change
the persistent setting.

The default UI-first rule exists because API actions are invisible (you don't
see what's being sent), often require separate auth tokens you may not have
configured, and can have a much larger blast radius than a visible mis-click.
Only use `/allow-api` when you've decided you want that tradeoff for a specific
job. See [security model](security-model.md#allow-api-flag).

## Run-capture suffixes

These are intentionally omitted from `/help` and autocomplete.

Append `/record [--save-as <filename>]` to the end of a normal prompt to start
recording the current tab immediately before the run, then stop and save the
WebM when that run settles (Chrome only).

Append `/screenshot [--save-as <filename>]` to save viewport screenshots
immediately before and after the run (Chrome and Firefox). For example,
`Test the checkout /screenshot --save-as checkout.png` saves
`checkout-before.png` and `checkout-after.png`; without `--save-as`, WebBrain
uses timestamped filenames.

For the Chrome diagnostic suffix, WebBrain may reactivate the originating run
tab before saving the after screenshot. Firefox captures that tab directly
without activating it. If the recording or initial screenshot cannot be
started and saved, the run is not sent. Standalone `/record` and `/screenshot`
keep their existing behavior.

## Exports, snapshots, and workflows

Full schemas and privacy properties for every export live in
[export and workflow formats](export-and-workflow-formats.md). The short
version:

- **Settings snapshots** use `webbrain-config/1` and include all portable
  Settings values, including provider, vision, transcription, and CapSolver API
  keys, profile data, user memory, custom skills, and permission choices. **The
  JSON is plaintext and should be stored securely.** Device-bound Cloud Sync
  sessions/device IDs, conversations, traces, scheduled jobs, usage counters,
  and accumulated spend are not exported.
- **Saved workflows** use a separate `webbrain-workflow/1` schema; they are not
  raw trace replays. Historical `ref_id` values, action CSS selectors,
  coordinates, query strings, fragments, and typed field values are excluded.
  Typed values become runtime parameters, and each action is bound to the
  recorded origin and URL family. At run time WebBrain resolves a fresh
  accessibility-tree target and executes through the normal Act permission,
  submit-confirmation, and verification gates. Ambiguous targets fail closed. If
  an action may already have happened but its result is unknown, replay stops
  instead of retrying it. Runtime parameter values are not saved to the
  workflow, conversation, user memory, replay trace, or Agent fallback prompt;
  they are still delivered to the target page by the requested browser action.
  The original opt-in source trace remains separate and can contain raw tool
  arguments until the user deletes that trace.
- If replay starts outside the saved origin or URL family, deterministic replay
  hands control to the Agent with the sanitized start scope so normal
  navigation, permission, and verification rules can recover the workflow
  instead of ending it immediately.
- **Portable workflow files** contain the raw sanitized `webbrain-workflow/1`
  definition and are limited to 1 MiB. Export re-normalizes the definition
  before download. Import normalizes it again, assigns a fresh local ID and
  timestamps, and never overwrites an existing workflow, so the same file can
  safely move between Chrome, Firefox, and WebBrain Cloud.
